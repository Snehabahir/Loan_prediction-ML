Project Title: Loan Prediction using Machine Learning
1. Introduction
Objective: The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not based on various factors.
Importance: Loan default prediction is crucial for financial institutions to minimize risk and make informed lending decisions.
2. Dataset
Source: The dataset used is from a hypothetical financial institution containing historical data of loan applicants.
Features: Includes attributes such as applicant's income, credit history, loan amount, loan term, employment history, etc.
Target Variable: Binary outcome indicating whether the loan was repaid (0) or defaulted (1).
3. Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Feature scaling and normalization if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing distributions of variables.
Analyzing correlations between features and the target variable.
Feature Engineering:
Creating new features if needed (e.g., debt-to-income ratio).
Encoding categorical variables.
Model Selection:
Choosing appropriate algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
Considering ensemble methods for better performance.
